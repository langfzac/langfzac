### Hi, I'm Zach

I'm an astronomy researcher at the [University of Washington](https://depts.washington.edu/astron/) in Seattle. I'm interested in many things, including: dynamics, planet formation, and parameter inference methods. Currently, I build software tools for characterize transiting exoplanets and modeling fast-moving solar system objects. Check out my work below!
