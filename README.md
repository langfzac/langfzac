### Hi, I'm Zach

I'm an astrophysics graduate student at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.physics.upenn.edu/) in Philadelphia. I'm interested in many things, including: dynamics, planet formation, high-performance computing, and data analysis methods. Currently, I work on characterizing exoplanet systems, and I study the dynamics of stars within galaxies. Check out some of my work below!
